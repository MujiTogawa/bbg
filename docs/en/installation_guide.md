# Installation Guide

## Windows / macOS

Installer or `dmg` package is available in [GitHub Releases]

## Arch Linux / Manjaro

You can install the software from AUR. Choose only one from the following two packages: [bbg](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bbg/) and [bbg-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bbg-git/).

## Debian and other debian-based distributions

Currently the `deb` package built from GitHub Releases still has bugs. Errors may occur during the installation progress and the internal `chrome-sandbox` inside the software may not function properly. If you mind about this, you can refer to the next section of this guide to use AppImage version of the software.

## Other Linux distributions

The AppImage package is available in [GitHub Releases]. To use it, firstly execute the following command to add executable permissions to it.

```
chmod +x the_appimage_file_that_you_have_downloaded
```

Then double-click the program file.
